# Future Society
Picture 12 to 30 people living together in a big house or some sort of living space. Could be a very large aparment, or farm, etc.

The people in these shared living spaces are either:

1. Just an individual with no kids.
2. In a partnership with another indivdual but raising no kids together.
3. An individual with N kids.
4. A partnership with two people, raising N kids.
5. A partnership with three people, raising N kids.

You can chose to start your own `living_space` (LS) and be the founding member or members.

Or you can chose to apply to an existing one.

Each LS can explain it's desire combination of people, parterships, and kids. Some might be 100% kid free. Some might be all families. Some might be in between with young partners thinking about having or adopting their first child.
